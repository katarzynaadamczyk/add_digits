# Add Digits

This project solves following problem found on Daily Interview Pro newsletter:
Given a number like 159, add the digits repeatedly until you get a single number.

Project was done in C++, you need to open the project in Codeblocks to check it for yourself.

It is my first project added on GitHub.
